1. Document; 
2. IN v0.2 release of 'xml' (when parsers.js 0.2 and Locator is done...): 

	CREATE the 'Validator' API for XML!
	Don't want to create any of it before Locator is finished (and TypeScript support has finally arrived...)

3. IN THE FUTURE: 

	Create a COMPLETE reversal of the 'parser' - the generator MUST BE ABLE to generate tokens' sequences (SAME reversal order as the Parser);

4. FOR DOCUMENTATION (API-related): 

	1. THE 'MAPS'! 

		Each and EVERY function from them MUST be reachable by the user directly!
		Fix that! [update docs...]; 

	2. Examples: 

		Add a reminder to look at the examples of how the function works ('test' directory)
