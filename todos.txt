1. Test; 
2. Document; 
3. IN v0.2 release of 'xml' (when parsers.js 0.2 and Locator is done...): 

	CREATE the 'Validator' API for XML!
	Don't want to create any of it before Locator is finished (and TypeScript support has finally arrived...)

4. IMPORTANT: the parser is ALMOST finished, HOWEVER... 

	It RETAINS the white spaces right BEFORE the end of a tag... 
	They are supposed to be ignored. SOLUTION: add a 'text-stripping' step.
