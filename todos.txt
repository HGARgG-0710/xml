1. IN v0.2 release of 'xml' (when parsers.js 0.2 and Locator is done...): 

	CREATE the 'Validator' API for XML!
	Don't want to create any of it before Locator is finished (and TypeScript support has finally arrived...)

2. IN THE FUTURE: 

	Create a COMPLETE reversal of the 'parser' - the generator MUST BE ABLE to generate tokens' sequences (SAME reversal order as the Parser);

3. Also: 	

	Support creation of diverse "xml-like" grammars; 
	Namely: 

		1. Allow optional parsing/non-parsing of certain tags; 
			This (specifically) applies to SVG-like formats, where one needs to be able to "inject" 
				a foreign parser into the contents of a given Tag; 
		2. Allow one to have specific TAG-Set-BASED Validator-s; 
			To permit only a SPECIFIC set of signatures for each tag, and only if they belong to the set of permitted tags; 
		3. Permit/forbid certain aspects of a parser (example: HTML); 
			In HTML, one can do: 

				<input type="text"> # correct 
			
			Whereas in XML, one is forced to do: 

				<input type="text"/>
			
			Permit non-closing single tags [AND their recognition...];
