1. Test; 
2. Document; 
3. IN v0.2 release of 'xml' (when parsers.js 0.2 and Locator is done...): 

	CREATE the 'Validator' API for XML!
	Don't want to create any of it before Locator is finished (and TypeScript support has finally arrived...)

4. Things to fix in the 'XML generator', before proceeding with docs and API cleaning...: 

	1. The fact that '->" (THE QUOTES ARE NOT PRESERVED!)

		This (pretty much) is impossible to fix (due to how 'element' is made), 
			SO, instead, add 'FIXERS' for strings - replaces all the " and ' with appropriate 'entities'; 

5. IN THE FUTURE: 

	Create a COMPLETE reversal of the 'parser' - the generator MUST BE ABLE to generate tokens' sequences (SAME reversal order as the Parser);
