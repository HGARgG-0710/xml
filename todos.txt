1. Document; 
2. IN v0.2 release of 'xml' (when parsers.js 0.2 and Locator is done...): 

	CREATE the 'Validator' API for XML!
	Don't want to create any of it before Locator is finished (and TypeScript support has finally arrived...)

3. IN THE FUTURE: 

	Create a COMPLETE reversal of the 'parser' - the generator MUST BE ABLE to generate tokens' sequences (SAME reversal order as the Parser);
4. Refactor [parsers.js and 'one'];
